/* Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4 million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Project Euler No. 2

You read that right: 4 million. You'll want to break this problem down a little, I think.

You must be able to print the answer to the console. */
