/* Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed 4 million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

Project Euler No. 2

You read that right: 4 million. You'll want to break this problem down a little, I think.

You must be able to print the answer to the console. */


var sum = 0;
var x = 1;
var y = 2;

while(x <= 4000000) { // 4mil since asks for values not exceeding 4 million
	if (x % 2 === 0) { // checks if number is divisible by 2 to check if even
		sum += x; // returns the sum to hold the value of the totals plus x that is looped
	}
	var z = x + y; // z holds sums of x and y
	x = y; // changes variables since each loop needs to give value of previous variable as well as new one
	y = z;
